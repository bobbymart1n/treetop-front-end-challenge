# Treetop Commons Front-End Challenge

**04.30.19**

### By Bobby Martin

## Description

This project was built to represent basic front-end principles using technology that Treetop Commons talked about in the Junior Front End Developer job description.

## Setup

To run the project in your local development environment, use the following instructions to get up and running.

- First clone this repository
- After the repository has been cloned, `cd` into the project directory
- Once in the project directory run: `npm install` or `yarn`
- Once dependencies have finished installing, open the project in the preferred text editor and add your Giphy API Key to the `API_KEY` constant in `constants.js`
- Once all the necessary dependencies are installed and you've entered your API Key run: `npm start` or `yarn start`

_I didn't include a reference to the build script as deployment isn't necessary for this project._

## Technology Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
